## Graph coloring

This is sadly not, but I wanted to submit it anyway.
This code can run and it is generating a random graph and from this, it is calculating the coloring.

To run it, first install all the packages, this can be done with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Then just execute the main.py file with `python main.py`.
